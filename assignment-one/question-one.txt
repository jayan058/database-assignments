1. Difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE
     DELETE:
       Deletes rows from a table based on a condition.
       Each row deletion is logged individually, which can be slower for large datasets.
       Can activate triggers.
       Can use a WHERE clause to specify which rows to delete
     TRUNCATE:
       Deletes all rows from a table without logging individual row deletions.
       Truncate can be faster for large datasets.
       Cannot activate triggers.
       Cannot use a WHERE clause; removes all rows.

2. Execution Order for Query Processing
     FROM: Tables are joined to form the base dataset.
     WHERE: Filters the rows in the base dataset.
     GROUP BY: Groups the filtered dataset based on columns.
     HAVING: Filters the groups formed by the GROUP BY clause.
     SELECT: Selects the required columns from the dataset.
     ORDER BY: Sorts the result set.
     LIMIT: Limits the number of rows in the final result set.


3. Difference between UNION and UNION ALL
     UNION:
      Removes duplicate rows from the result set.   
      Slightly slower due to the additional step of removing duplicates.
    UNION ALL:
      Includes all duplicates in the result set.
      Faster since it does not perform the step of removing duplicates.
